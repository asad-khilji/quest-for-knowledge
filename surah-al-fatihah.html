        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah</h2>

        <p class="blog" style="line-height: 2;">Our Messenger was overwhelmed with opposition and from amidst that opposition Allah gave him something to be optimistic about. Our Messenger was given the seven that are highly praised and often repeated and then Allah gave him the Quran. In every opportunity we recite the fatihah and in every salah we repeat the fatihah. Fatihah shapes our view for the rest of the Quran. I invite you to the first step of the journey of the Quran the Fatihah.</p>
