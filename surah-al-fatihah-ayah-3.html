       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 3</h2>

       <h3>Introduction</h3>

       <p>The first three ayat of the fatihah introduce us to Allah. Praise and thanks belongs to Allah because He is Rabb, Ar Rahman, Ar Raheem, and Malik Yom Ad Deen. In the previous ayah Allah mentions how He is extremely loving and caring. When someone is that much loving and caring then people may not take them seriously. You think it is an open license to do whatever you want. Allah's names Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem are amazing, but people could take advantage of Allah's love and care for us. This ayah mentions Allah being the Master of the day of Judgment and it balances everything so people to not take advantage of Allah's extreme love and care.</p>

       <h3>The Story of a Master and a Slave</h3>

       <p>There is a master and a slave. The master tells the slave you are free to do what you want just do not cross this line. The slave lives his life and stays away from the line. One day he goes close to the line and trips and falls on the other side of the line. The slave sees the master and the master says nothing. The next day the slave pretends to fall on the other side of the line. The master sees and still says nothing. Then the slave has one foot on one side of the line and one foot on the other side. The master sees and says nothing. Then the slave spends all his time on the other side of the line. The master sees and says nothing. Then years go by and the master calls the slave over. The master tells the slave remember when I told you not to cross that line and the slave says yes I remember. The master says I was recording all the times you crossed the line and decided to unish you now all at once.</p>

       <h3>Reality</h3>

       <p>Allah is our Master and we are His slaves. Allah told us these are some lines and do not cross them. We sometimes slip and fall then we turn back to Allah. We then realize nothing happened and Allah is extremely loving and caring. Then we fall more into sin. When someone gives them a reminder, they say leave me alone Allah is extremely loving and caring.</p>

       <h3>Malik</h3>

       <p>Malik means owner and king. Previously Allah mentions the name Rabb and it includes other names like giver of gifts. Malik only means Master, Owner, and King. Things are becoming serious. The love and care of Allah is being removed in this ayah. An owner owns small things and a king owns big things. On the day of judgment big things will happen. The oceans will boil and the mountains will melt. On this day every last deed will also be counted. Allah takes complete ownership on the day of judgment. It is a day when the big things and small things comer together.</p>

       <h3>Yom</h3>

       <p>Yom means a day. A day is a unit of time. Human beings have experience of ownership, but we can never own time. Allah takes ownership of something only He can take ownership of. Allah can make this day long and short. When you own something then you can mnaipulate it and control it. Time is like a bag. We are living in time and we are inside the bag. Allah owns the day and everything inside the day.</p>

       <h3>Ad Deen</h3>

       <p>Ad Deen means the judgment. A day when everyone and everything will be dealt with. When every issue will be dealt with. When every debt will be paid and compensated. It is the completing of the record, which is why we say Alhamdulillah. Human beings desire justice, especially for other people. This world is unfair. There are people who do a lot of good and a lot of bad is done to them. There are people who do a lot of evil and they seem to get away with it. Justice does not exist in this world. Justice will be served on judgment day. Nothing you did will go uncounted for.</p>

       <h3>Allah's Love, Care, and Justice</h3>

       <p>Let us think of a number line. Allah's love and care is positive. The justice of Allah is neutral. The punishment of Allah is negative. Allah does not compare His love and care with His punishment, rather Allah compares His love and care with His justice. Everything Allah does is postive and neutral, and not negative or any form of punishment. People are compensated with what they have done, and rewarded out of the love and care of Allah. This is the relatity of Allah. It is the fairness of Allah that will lead people to Jahannum. It is the love and care of Allah that leads people to Jannah.</p>

       <h3>An Easy Account</h3>

       <p>Some people get their book in their right hand and some people get in in their left hand and behind their back. Those that recieved their book in their right hand are about to walk through the gates of Jannah. They expect to be stopped and asked several questions. The angels say go ahead its alright you can enter Jannah. There were mistakes and sins but it was overlooked. You are shocked and overly excited because you made it to Jannah. Then you say check it out and read my book. I knew I was going to make it. These weere people whose book was not checked. Those who are questioned even once is done.</p>

       <h3>Conclusion</h3>

       <p>Allah says human being what deluded you from your most generous Master. I was extremely loving and caring. I gave you so many chances, but you decided to takes advantage of those chances. You remembered Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem, but forgot about Malik Yom Ad Deen. How could you do that to yourself? In these three ayat is the complete introduction to Allah. Here Allah talked to us, and now we are talking to Allah. Fatihah teaches us that we have to be in conversation with Allah. This is a direct connection with Allah. No one comes between you and Allah. Messengers came to connect Allah to the people. Every human being is being honored by Allah, because Allah the most important being is talking to you and we are talking to Him directly.</p>
