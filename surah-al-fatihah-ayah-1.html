       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 1</h2>

       <h3>Introduction</h3>

       <p>We will discuss some of the aspects and beauty of the Fatihah. This is not a tafseer of the Fatihah. The rest of the Quran is a tafseer of the Fatihah. This surah was revealed in Makkah. The Fatihah begins with Alhamdulillah, because of a Hadith Qudsi. In the Hadith Qudsi, Allah mentions that I divided the prayer between Me and my slave. When the Hadith begins it starts with Alhamdulillah and not bismillah. Also Allah calls the fatihah the prayer. So the fatihah is the essence of the prayer and without it your prayer will be invalid. Allah responds to us whenever we recite the fatihah. It is a direct conversation we have with Allah.</p>

       <h3>Hadith Qudsi</h3>

       <p>When we say praise and thanks is for Allah then Allah responds by saying My slave has praised Me. When we say Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem then Allah responds by saying My slave has praised Me more. When we say Master of the Day of Judgment then Allah responds by saying My slave has glorified Me. When we say You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help then Allah responds by saying this is between Me and My slave and My slave will have whatever he or she is asking for. When we say guide us to the straight path then Allah responds by saying it is guaranteed. When we say the path of those whom you have favored then Allah responds by saying it is guaranteed. When we say not the path of those who earned wrath nor of the lost then Allah responds by saying it is guaranteed. When we say Ameen then the angels say ameen with us.</p>

       <h3>Praise and Thanks</h3>

       <p>Hamd means praise and thanks. Praise and thanks are two different ideas. You can have praise without thanks, and thanks without praise. You can praise a nice car, but you do not thank the car. You can praise a beautiful mountain, but you do not thank the mountain. You can praise the performance of the athlete, but you do not thank the athlete. Ibrahim thanks his father for raising him, but he does not praise his worship of the idols. Musa thanks the phaorah for raising him, but he does not praise him as a god. When we say Alhamdulillah we need to have two attitudes in mind praise and thanks. We are praising Allah and thanking Allah at the same time. Alhamdulillah is a statement of optimism. When we say alhamdulillah we should not complain. We have to find a genuine and sincere reason to praise and thank Allah. Our deen begins with a positive attitude. This is a complete change in thought and attitude. Gratitude is limited to a reaction, but the Hamd of Allah is not limited to a reaction. So Allah does not need us to praise or thank Him.</p>

       <h3>Nouns and Verbs</h3>

       <p>There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Nouns do not have past, present, or future tense. Verbs are either stuck in the past, present, or future tense. Nouns do not require anyone or anything to do an action. For verbs you need someone or something to do an action. Nouns are timeless and independent. Verbs are temporary and it needs a doer. Praise and thanks is an idea, which is a noun. The praise and thanks for Allah is timeless and independent. So Allah does not need anyone or anything to praise and thank Him. Allah is full of praise and thanks by Himself.</p>

       <h3>The Two Kinds of Sentences</h3>

       <p>There are two kinds of sentences, Informational Sentences and Emotional Sentences. Informational Sentences communicate information and it consists of a right and wrong answer. Emotional Sentences communicate emotion and it does not consist of a right or wrong answer. Allah says Alhamdulillah which is an informational and emotional sentence. If Allah said Innal Hamdulillah then it would be an informational sentence only and not emotional.</p>

       <h3>Reversing the Order</h3>

       <p>Alhamdulillah means praise and thanks is for Allah. Wa lillah hil Hamd means praise and thanks is only for Allah. Praise and thanks is only for Allah is used when arguing with someone. Surah Al Fatihah is a statement from the heart and not arguing with anyone. We already know praise and thanks is for Allah. In surah al jathiya Allah says praise and thanks is only for Allah, because it is arguing with the polytheists. When you say praise and thanks is only for Allah, it means praise and thanks is for Allah and for no one else. There is a disagreement and a debate. It means you must correct someone. The only way to correct someone is by saying praise and thanks is only for Allah.</p>

       <h3>The Name of Allah</h3>

       <p>When you use the name of Allah then you include and appreciate all the names and attributes of Allah. Allah is the proper name of Allah. Names are important in an introduction. Surah Al Fatihah is Allah introducing Himself to us. When using the name of Allah it clears any confusion of praise and thanks being for anybody or anything else because someone could have the wrong concept of God. It is like in the story of Musa when the magicians fell into sajdah and got up and said we believe in the Rabb. The pharoah taught they were talking about him, but then they clarified and said the Rabb of Musa and Haroon.</p>

       <h3>The Ultimate Praise and Thanks</h3>

       <p>Praise and thanks could be for other than Allah. The name of our Messenger is Muhammad, which comes from the same root as Hamd. Muhammad means someone who has a lot of praise and thanks done of him. So you could praise and thank other people, but ultimately praise and thanks goes back to Allah. The ultimate, genuine, sincere, and timeless praise and thanks is for Allah who is independent from His creation.</p>

       <h3>Rabb</h3>

       <p>Rabb consists of five names and attributes of Allah, which are Malik, Sayyed, Murrabi, Qayyim, and Munnim. Malik means owner and Master. Sayyed means someone who is in control and in charge. Murrabi is someone who makes sure someone and something grows, develops, and improves it constantly. Qayyim means someone who is constantly taking care of someone or something and who makes sure it remains in tact. Munnim is the giver of gifts. Whatever Allah gives us is a gift. When you receive a gift then you cannot complain because a gift is something we did not deserve. A gift is something beyond that which is earned or deserved.</p>

       <h3>The Master and Slave Relationship</h3>

       <p>The number one quality to praise and thank Allah is that He is our Master and we are His slaves. Humanity has experienced slavery. There are some negative connations of slavery, but Allah is a special kind of Master. Human beings have this delusion of freedom. We often hate it when people tell us what to do. We want to be free, but there is no such thing as freedom. We are enslaved to someone or something such as governement, employer, society, people, fashion, money, etc. When you enslave yourself to Allah then you are free from all other forms of slavery.</p>

       <h3>Alameen</h3>

       <p>Alameen means nations and people. Someone who needs a warning. Nations and people of every generation, every culture, in every time and place. Allah wants all nations and people to improve and get better. Allah does not want to destroy nations. Allah wants to save nations. Allah cares for all nations and people. No nation or people are excluded from the Rahma of Allah. Surah Al Fatihah is about nations and people. It is about how Allah owns you and me. The message in this surah is personalized to people, you and me.</p>
