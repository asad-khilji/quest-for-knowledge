       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 7</h2>
 
       <h3>Those who had wrath upon them</h3>

       <p>We are asking Allah to keep us away from the path of those who had wrath upon them. These people had beneficial knowledge but did not act upon it. These people received anger and had anger directed towards. This word is used as a verb. These people are found in the past, present, and future. You can find a case study of these people in the Quran throughout the stories of the Jews in the Quran. It is not talking about all the Jews though.</p>

       <h3>Those who are Lost</h3>

       <p>Those who did not have beneficial knowledge, but they acted in a wrong manner. You can find a case study of these people in the Quran throughout the stories of the Christians. It is not talking about all the christian though.</p>

       <h3>Example</h3>

       <p>There are two boys, Imaad and Waleed. I go upstairs for a phone and before I go I tell Imad to not eat the cookies. I come back from my phone call and see both of them eating the cookies. I am angry at Imad because I told him not to eat the cookies. I am not as angry at Waleed but I still hold him responsible. Waleed should have asked me instead of Imad. One I am angry at and the other I am not as angry at but I still hold him responsible.</p>
