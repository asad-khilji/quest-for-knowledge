        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Quran from a Literary Perspective</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Divine speech is broken up into two parts. One part is micro studies and another part is macro studies. Micro studies is the study of an ayah and a zoomed in picture of the Quran. Macro studies is the study of a surah and a zoomed out picture of the Quran. The Quran is like a garden. You could appreciate the garden zoomed in by focusing on the beauty of a flower. You could also appreciate the garden from a zoomed out view by looking at the garden as a whole. This way we can appreciate the Quran in a wholistic way. This course will encourage the Quran to be studied and appreciated as Literature even for the non muslims.</p>

        <h3>The Quran</h3>

        <p>The Quran is made of 114 surahs. A surah is not the same as a chapter. Chapters are in chronological order and there is no repetition. Surahs do not have a chronological order and there is repetition. The Quran has its own perfect order. Within a surah there are ayat. An ayah is not the same as a verse. Verses are associated with poetry and the bible. The Quran is not like the bible or poetry. An ayah is also not a sentence. An ayah could contain less than a sentence or more than a sentence. Allah has set His own standard for the Quran. The Quran cannot be compared to any other literature.</p>

        <h3>What is an Ayah?</h3>

        <p>An ayah is the most fascinating words of the arabic language. Its root words are hamza, ya, and ya. Allah used this word ayah to describe all of reality and everything that exists. An ayah is something that has value. So everything we experience is valuable. An ayah is something that makes you ask questions and peaks your curosity. An ayah is something that gives you direction. Every ayah and everything points you back to Allah. An ayah is something that is amazing. It is supposed to make you wonder. An ayah is something that gets your attention, so you can learn lessons from it. An ayah is something that gives you certainty and conviction. The ayat are enough to make you convinced. An ayah is something that has meaning. Everything is meaningful. An ayah is something that gives you purpose. An ayah is a sign.</p>

        <h3>The Arabic Language</h3>

        <p>There are three kinds of arabic spoken arabic, formal arabic, and old arabic. Spoken arabic is used in everyday language. It is dialetical and each group of arabs have their own dialects. It is also changing and very dynamic. Formal arabic is used in writing, television, and other professional settings. Old arabic is the language of the Quran. Old arabic died but it was preserved by the same companions who preserved the Quran and Hadith. There were three preservation movements. To preserve the Quran, Hadith, and Arabic. Scholars would go out into the desert to hear the old arabic to understand the Quran better.</p>

        <h3>Example of How Arabic Became So Refined?</h3>

        <p>There is a poet and his wife complains to him about poverty. So the poet responds to his wife with poetry. He says heavy rain is at war with a house on a hill. Heavy rain is being compared to wealth. The poet is saying wealth comes to me from above. But when it comes because I am a high person it leaves me and goes down to the people in the flood and the mud.</p>

        <h3>How Arabic Became Refined?</h3>

        <p>For many years everyone left the arabs alone because it was just a desert and oil was not discovered yet. Over the years arabic became more and more refined. The arabs now had the world's greatest language. There was not much for them to be proud of but they were proud of their language. When a nation is proud of something then they take care of it. So the arabs really took care of their language. Over time outside influence came in and language started to go down. So efforts were made to preserve the arabic language. Reading the Quran with dirty glasses is like reading it with spoken or formal arabic. Reading the Quran with clean glasses is like reading it with old arabic. It is like looking at a dimaond with clean and dirty glasses.</p>
