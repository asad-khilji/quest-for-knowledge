        <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Quran from a Literary Perspective</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Divine speech is broken up into two parts. One part is micro studies and another part is macro studies. Micro studies is the study of an ayah and a zoomed in picture of the Quran. Macro studies is the study of a surah and a zoomed out picture of the Quran. The Quran is like a garden. You could appreciate the garden zoomed in by focusing on the beauty of a flower. You could also appreciate the garden from a zoomed out view by looking at the garden as a whole. This way we can appreciate the Quran in a wholistic way. This course will encourage the Quran to be studied and appreciated as Literature even for the non muslims.</p>

        <h3>The Quran</h3>

        <p>The Quran is made of 114 surahs. A surah is not the same as a chapter. Chapters are in chronological order and there is no repetition. Surahs do not have a chronological order and there is repetition. The Quran has its own perfect order. Within a surah there are ayat. An ayah is not the same as a verse. Verses are associated with poetry and the bible. The Quran is not like the bible or poetry. An ayah is also not a sentence. An ayah could contain less than a sentence or more than a sentence. Allah has set His own standard for the Quran. The Quran cannot be compared to any other literature.</p>

        <h3>What is an Ayah?</h3>

        <p>An ayah is the most fascinating words of the arabic language. Its root words are hamza, ya, and ya. Allah used this word ayah to describe all of reality and everything that exists. An ayah is something that has value. So everything we experience is valuable. An ayah is something that makes you ask questions and peaks your curosity. An ayah is something that gives you direction. Every ayah and everything points you back to Allah. An ayah is something that is amazing. It is supposed to make you wonder. An ayah is something that gets your attention, so you can learn lessons from it. An ayah is something that gives you certainty and conviction. The ayat are enough to make you convinced. An ayah is something that has meaning. Everything is meaningful. An ayah is something that gives you purpose. An ayah is a sign.</p>
