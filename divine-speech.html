        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Divine Speech</h2>

        <p class="blog" style="line-height: 2;">Many years ago when I started my own journey into the Quran, I found myself having a lot of questions about the Quran as I read the translation. Like why is there so much repetition in the Quran? How is there no chronological order? How come some surahs are long and some are short? How come it is not in subject order? Why is there one part of the story in one place and another part in another place? These kinds of question kept popping up in my mind as I read the Quran. It was not like any other book that I read. So as I started exploring the answers to these questions, I came to realize what makes the Quran so beautiful and truly a divine speech. It is incredible that what started off as criticism became something that strenthened my faith in this book. This inspired the first ever course called divine speech. This course was taught throughout the world. I feel this is the second step I would like you to take into your journey of the Quran. It will answer all your questions you have. The purpose of this course is to learn something new about the Quran and to gain a new appreciation of the Quran as a divine speech. This will reinforce your faith and confidence in the divine beauty and power of the Quran. So let us begin this journey, Divine Speech.</p>
