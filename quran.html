        <p class="blog" style="line-height: 2;">Hearts around the world want to feel what Allah says directly without translation. Hearts around the world want to heal with Allah's counsel. Hearts around the world want to pick themselves back up. They want to get a second chance. They want to find courage and guidance. Hearts around the world want to find the loneliness they feel deep inside, and they know the best first step to do that is to befriend Allah with His own words. Thousands of hearts took a brave step to make that journey a reality. Thousands of hearts continue their quest and thousands more have joined them. Now its time to nourish your own heart and begin your own journey of the Quran. Its time you put in the time and energy to invest into this book. Its time you take a leap to Allah's words. Let me help you. Join me and thousands of other Quran seekers. Allah says isn't it time yet for those who claimed to believe that they should be overwhelmed with remembering Allah and with what came down of the truth. So Allah asks us isn't it time and its time we answer, Yes! It is time and that time is now.</p>
