       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 5</h2>

       <h3>Guidance and Water</h3>

       <p>Surah Al Fatihah led us to the conclusion that the most deaperate need we have is guidance from Allah. Out of all things we need help in, we ask to be guided. Guidance is compared to water. You need guidance just like you need water. We need to ask guidance over and over again. Allah gives us eveerything without us asking for it. The only thing Allah gives us when we ask Him is guidance. Guidance is so precious and so quickly removed that even our Messenger has to ask for it over and over again. Guidance cannot be passed down to your children. We cannot guide anyone. Allah guides whom He wills.</p>

       <h3>The Way We Ask for Guidance</h3>

       <p>If someone is thirsty but the thirst is not so much then he will forget about it if he does not get it. But if someone is dying of thirst then he will ask again and again. He will become more and more desperate for water. This is how we need to ask for guidance. We must desperately ask for guidance from Allah. Being desperate is not shown in your words, but in your attitude. With what attitude are you reciting the fatihah. Attitude comes from your heart. Allah is concerned with words that come from the heart. You can recite the fatihah and not ask for guidance. You can recite with proper tajweed and not ask for guidance. You can recite in front of the Kaaba and not ask for guidance. You can recite the fatihah correctly and ask for guidance.</p>

       <h3>The Master and Slave Relationship</h3>

       <p>A slave does whatever the Master tells them to do. A Master has to give instructions to the slave. Allah is our Master and we are His slaves. Master and guidance are talked about together in the Quran.</p>

       <h3>Guidance and Gift</h3>

       <p>When someone is lost in the desert then the most important gift you can recieve is guidance. Even if you have water but no guidance then you will eventually run out of water and die. But if you have guidance then you can be saved. So your biggest lifeline in the desert is guidance. We are asking Allah for the greatest of all gifts, which is guidance.</p>

       <h3>Knowledge and Guidance</h3>

       <p>You can have a lot of knowledge of Quran but not have guidance. Guidance is not one act. When someone took the shahadah they took their first guided act. Everyday we make a series of decisions. We could make the right decision or the wrong decision. In every decision we need someone's advise. Allah is offering His constant advice through His guidance. Knowledge we can increase, but guidance is only increased by Allah. The practical gauge for how guided you is how moved you are in your salah. We must seek knoweldge but never forget why you are seeking knowledge. Knowledge is not the goal, Guidance is the goal. A slave is humble and a slave has nothing to be proud of.</p>

       <h3>The Straight Path</h3>

       <p>Seerat is a straight path that is long and wide. We are asking Allah to be on a journey. We can see what is coming ahead there is no confusion. Other people are on the road too. Some people are ahead of you, some people are behind you, and some people are next to you. We should not compare ourselves to anyone but ourselves. We can be inspired by each other, but we each have our own path. We usually ask directions to a destination, but in the fatihah we are asking to be guided to a path. We must continue to progress each and every day. We must look at ourselves and ask have I improved and progressed from yesterday.</p>

       <h3>The Upwards Path</h3>

       <p>Seerat is a path that is upwards. Allah raises us as we go up the straight path. Going up requires effort and when you stop going up then you go down. The Quran lifts you up, but the temptations of this world pull you down. The higher up you go the more dangerous it is when you fall. If you fall from a short height then you can get back up and continue. But when you fall from such a high height then you get immersed in this world. It gets difficult to get back up. This is why the great scholars and people of taqwa are crying a lot.</p>
