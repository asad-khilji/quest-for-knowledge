        <h2 style="text-align: center;">A Quest for Knowledge</h2>

        <p class="blog" style="line-height: 2;">Hey everyone welcome to the courses section of this site. Here you are going to find a bunch of different kinds of topics, and I want to introduce you to some of that. There is a section for Quran, Seerah, and History. There is a lot of content on this site. It could become overwhelming at first. You should not get too overwhelmed and just take it slow, one step at a time. You may spend just a few minutes a day reading some of the notes I have here for you. I pray that Allah allows us to continue our quest for beneficial knowledge and to implement everything we read.</p>
