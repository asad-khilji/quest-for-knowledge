       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 6</h2>
 
       <h3>The Path of Those You Favored</h3>    

       <p>We ask Allah to be on the path of those whom He has favored. They walk in a relax way like how cattle walks. We are asking Allah to this difficult path very easy, smooth, and luxurious. It is like going up an exculator. Allah made the path easy for those before us. We are asking to be on their path as well. Those people made the effort and Allah made their difficult path very easy for them. The result of going up this path is from Allah. These people are only found in the past. Allah told us in the Quran that they were on the straight path. We look for role models of those who already made this journey. The Quran is full of stories of these people. Every story of the Quran is revelant for us until the day of judgment. These people are now my companions on this journey. These people had beneficical knowledge and they acted upon it.</p>

       <h3>Who are the People on this path?</h3>

       <ul>
            <li>The Prophets</li>
            <li>Those who confirmed truth in the prophets</li>
            <li>The martyrs</li>
            <li>The righteous</li>
       </ul>
