        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Verbal Idioms in the Quran</h2>

        <h3>What is a Verbal Idiom?</h3>

        <p>A verbal idiom is an expression and figure of speech. For example there is I gave and I gave up. I gave means to give something. I gave up means to quit and not to continue. There is the word site. To a construction worker he is thinking of a construction site. To a web developer he is thinking of a web site. There is the word journal. To a accountant it is an audit of credits and debits. To a teenage girl it is a personal journal. To a professor it is an academic journal. You have the word whats up. It could mean what is above you or just expression for greeting a person.</p>

        <h3>Surah At Taha 20:14 - Coolness of the Eyes</h3>

        <p>Allah says to Musa, It is truly I, I am Allah! There is no god worthy of worship except Me. So worship Me alone and establish salah for my remembrance. The Prophet also says the coolness of my eyes is placed in the salah. Prayer is our support and strength, and joy for those people who Allah blessed them in their prayers. The Prophet also said O Bilal cool our eyes by giving the call to prayer. Musa talks with Allah and his eyes are cool. Then he talks with Pharoah and his eyes are warm. The Prophet is talking with his people and his eyes are warm. Then the Prophet talks with Allah then his eyes are cool.</p>

        <h3>Surah Al Furqan 25:74 - Coolness of the Eyes</h3>

        <p>They are those who pray, Our Master gift us with pious spouses and offspring who will be the coolness of our eyes, and make us models for the righteous. There is a storm outside with lots of stress. When they come home then they can find refuge and relief. We are asking Allah for a house that when we go to it is a happy house in which we are relieved. We look at our spouses and children and it makes us so happy that it makes us cry. We are asking Allah for tears of joy.</p>

        <h3>Surah Al Qasas 28:9 - Coolness of the Eyes</h3>

        <p>Pharoah's wife said to him This baby is the coolness of eyes for me and a source of joy for me and you. Do not kill him. Perhaps he may be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son. They were unaware of what was to come. The baby was so cute that the Pharoah and his wife could not take their eyes off him.</p>

        <h3>Surah Al Qasas 28:13 - Coolness of the Eyes</h3>

        <p>This is how We returned him to his mother so that her heart will be at ease, and she will experience the coolness of her eyes, and not feel grieved, and that she would know that the promise of Allah is always true. But most people do not know.</p>

        <h3>Surah Al Isra 17:24 - Lower Your Wings</h3>

        <p>And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say My Master have mercy upon them as they brought me up when I was small. We are being compared to birds. When a bird is about to fly it raises its wings, and when it lowers its wings then it is about to land. We are told to come back down to the earth. When a bird has wings it chooses to lower its wings. We have wings but we still remain humble. Before we were dependent on our parents. Then when we become independent then we still remain humble and lower our wings. It is time we show love and care to our parents because they had showed us love and care to us when we were small. Allah reversal the roles as we grow older.</p>

        <h3>Surah Al Taha 20:27 - Untie the Knot</h3>

        <p>Musa asks Allah to untie the knot from my tongue. Musa here is asking Allah for clarity in speech. Like when you have cables and it is all jumnbled up. You do not know where it begins or where it ends. When you entangle the wire then it is clear where each wire begins and ends. This is a dua for public speaking.</p>
