       <p>Allah is above the creation and not associated with any of the above parties. No one can resolve the above issues with justice except for Allah. This is the guidance to the straight path. Unless we go back to Allah the conflict will continue. There will be no peace or harmony without Allah. So who will be the judge who will bring balance and justice into this world.</p>
