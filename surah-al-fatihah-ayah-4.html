       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 4</h2>

       <h3>Iyyaka Nabudu</h3>

       <p>The fourth ayah of the fatihah begins in this way: It is only to You that we willingly give ourselves in slavery and worship. This is the time to use the word only. We make decisions based on our mind and heart. We make decisions because our heart is compelled towards someone or something. We also make decisions because we thought about something and our intellect brought us to a conclusion. We thought about what Allah said about praise and thanks. We gave it serious consideration. We were then shaken in our minds and hearts. Everytime we recite the fatihah we refresh our relationship with Allah. We must always ask why we are Muslim. Fatihah is screaming that people go back to the basics and refresh our commitment to Allah. We remind ourselves of this commitment every few hours in the salah.</p>

       <h3>Wa Iyaka Nastain</h3>

       <p>Now that we made this commitment, it is a very difficult commitment that we made. We realize that we are not the best slave. We realize that we will make mistakes and slip. So we ask for help. We say You alone we ask for help. The way to ask for help is to put in the effort then ask Allah for help. Success equals your efforts plus Allah's help. If you do not put in the efforts then Allah's help will not come. When you put in the effort and Allah's help still does not come then Allah wanted to teach you to be patient.</p>

       <h3>The Two Different Scenarios</h3>

       <p>In the first scenario you are driving then you have a flat tire. You stop on the side of the road and change the tire. Then you ask someone for help after exhusting yourself in effort. In the second scenario you have a flat tire. You stop at the side of the road. You ask for help and just watch the other person change the tire by himself.</p>

       <h3>The Two Extremes</h3>

       <p>One extreme is that Allah does everything and I do nothing. Another extreme is that I did everything by myself. Both these extremes are wrong. In Islam we have a balance and a middle path. We put in the effort then ask Allah for help.</p>

       <h3>The Kind of Help We Ask Allah</h3>

       <p>We asked for help, but we did not specify what we need help in. It is because the list is so big that we need help in everything. It is also because we are desperate. When you are desperate then you short on words. It is like a guy hanging on a tree about to fall of a cliff. He does not say excuse me I am about to fall from a very high place so could you help me. Instead he just yells HELP!!! There is a desperation in these words that is so powerful. We desperately turned back to Allah.</p>
