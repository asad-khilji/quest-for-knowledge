       <h2 style="text-align: center;">Surah Al Fatihah: Ayah 2</h2>

        <h3>Rahma</h3>

        <p>Rahma means love and care. This word comes from the same root word as rahm, which means the womb of a mother. The child in the womb does not have to worry about anything. Everything is completely taken care of by the mother. The child is completely wrapped up in the care of its mother. It has no idea what its mother is doing for it. Allah is many times more loving and caring than our mother. Allah is constantly taking care of us. We do not even know how much Allah is taking care of us. The child causes the mother pain and almost kills her. Yet the mother loves the child even more and cares for it constantly. The mother goes out of her way to show love and care to its child.</p>

        <h3>Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem</h3>

        <p>There are three qualities of the word Ar Rahman. The first quality is that the love and care of Allah is extreme. The second quality is that the love and care of Allah is happening right now. The third quality is that the love and care of Allah is temporary. There are two qualities of Ar Raheem. The first quality is that the love and care of Allah is permanent. The second quality is that the love and care of Allah is not happening right now.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>

        <p>You are very hungry. The food will be ready in 5 min. During those 5 min you are asked when do you want tomorrow. You say I do not care about tomorrow I need my food right now. Then after you ate the food and you are asked what you want to eat tomorrow. Then you say we can this or that. You cannot think about the future when you have a problem in the present.</p>

        <h3>Reality</h3>

        <p>Allah takes care of our immediate needs first with the name Ar Rahman. Then Allah takes care of our future with the name Ar Raheem. Allah knows who He created. We are impatient human beings who want everything right now.</p>

        <h3>What Ibn Abbas Says</h3>

        <p>Ibn Abbas says Ar Rahman is for everyone in this world and Ar Raheem is for the believers in the next life. It is because this world is temporary like the qualities of Ar Rahman are temporary. The next life is permanent like the qualities of Ar Raheem are permanent.</p>

        <h3>Commentary</h3>

        <p>You cannot imagine an ocean with high waves and an ocean that is calm both at the same time. The qualities of Ar Rahman are like an ocean with high waves. The qualities of Ar Raheem are like an ocean with calm waves. Allah is both qualities of Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem at the same time. So the rahma of Allah is beyond human comprehension.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>We started with praise and thanks is for Allah the Master of all nations and people. The quality of that Master is that He is unimaginably loving and caring. Now tell me what other master is loving and caring like Allah. You will not find anyone with this much love and care now or forever. We cannot be loving and caring to our own selves because we harm ourselves. Anything tells us to do it benefits us and Allah does not benefit or need anything. The highest state of Islam is ihsan and that is for yourself. Allah wants to lighten our burden and make our lives easier. Human beings place burdens on themselves and Allah removes them for us.</p>
